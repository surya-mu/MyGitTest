Test Engineer/QA Engineer AVP/VP/SVP 

1. What is Software
 It is a set of executable programs written in specific language 
Java, c, C#, Python
eg: google, FB,	 Whatsapp, Instagram (Mobile apps), Hospital mgmt 

2. What is Testing - QA(Test Engineer) -> Quality Assurance-> Act like police man(policing job)-> Quality will improve(80 or 90 95 or 100)-> Testing
It is to validate/check whether the expected and the Actual value matching or not against the customer requirement
Eg: car - should meet the customer expectation. software , automobile, mobile and pen
Registration & Login ...
Dev - Login
Test Plan(TM/TL) -> Defines the road map for the entire testing activity: Test Strategy(approach towards testing), scope of testing (various types testing)
Risks, test entry/exit criteria, test environments (QA env), trainings, schedule
3. S/W Testing
It is process of executing/testing with an intent of finding defect/bugs & the requirements are covered

Defect/Bug - Not meeting the expectation - lead to a defect

Defect is not matching any of the Test Cases, then we need to write a new Test case-> then map the defect to that TC

4. What is Quality - Is the product/application working as per the requirement within the budget & time
Meeting the customer requirement on time & within the budget -> Quality | RelQ - Reliable Quality

5. Error v/s Defect v/s Failure

Error - While writing a code if programmer find any mistakes from coding part like syntactical errors
then it is called Error

Defect - Expected -> Not equal to -> Actual : Bug
Bug life cycle -> Description, Steps, Screenshot, logs, Status -> New->Assigned-> In progress/Open -> Fixed -> Verify -> Close

Failure - The application or a product is facing any problem while using it is called Failure -> Engine failure

6. What is product and what is project

project - is designed and delivered to a particulate customer - Cooking for a family, tailor to stich - particular customer
Product - It is developed for multiple customers or for the entire market requirement - MS Office, ATM software with multiple users Eg - Tirupati Laddu,  MS office, Amazon

7. Ways of Software Testing - 2 types
a. Manual Testing - Process of conducting testing on application by the human interaction is called Manual Testing...Going outside with walk - More time
b. Automation Testing - Process of conducting the testing on application with the help of tools and s/w
Eg:Any vehicle (Tool) to reach the destination

8. SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle  - Requirement (BA,PO)-> Design(SA)-> Develop(Progmmer/developer)-> Test(QA)-> Deploy-> Maintenance
BA- Business Analyst or the PO - Product Owner, Content Writers - Documentation, SA -> Solution Architects -> Design 
Manager or Lead role -> Monitor the progress of the team (QA/Dev) and help them in resolving any conflicts (software licenses or environmental issues), clarity required w.r.t requirements
AUT - Application Under Test -> Phased manner by the developers do the coding

All implementation details of the project from day1 till end of the project
Requirement->Design-> Develop(coding)-> Testing -> deploying (host)->Maintenance

9. Who will bring/get the project for the company ?
CEO, Board people, Sales People, Vertical heads (Business Unit Heads), PO, PM - Leaders, Developers, Testers
RFP - Request for Proposal

Project Initiation (PI) - Project Manager (with domain knowledge)
Insurance - 
Medical - 
E-Commerce - 
Banking

Requirement Gathering - BA / PO - Static testing - 4 or 5 
BRS - Business Requirement Specification
SRS - Software Requirement Specification
SFS - Function Req
Use cases(Agile) - 

Environment - Dev env (Developer) -> QA Env (Testers) -> Stage env (pre-production/replica) Testers -> Production env (real/live/cust env)
None of the softwares are - Free from Defects -> QA job is to minize the no of defects

Project Planning - P.M 
------------------
Budget - 100 CR (Builder) Customer pay to develop -> Dev, test every invovled
Time - 2 years
Design - Technical/Solution Architect 
Coding - Programmer/Developer
Testing - Tester/QA
a. White-Box/Unit Testing - Programmer/Dev
Integration Testing - QA -> Combining 2 or more  features/modules
Blackbox Testing - Functionality without the knowledge of the code
User Interface (GUI) Testers - AUT
Functional - Login/logout, validation, reset, transactions (money transfer, appt schedule, taking policy) for AUT
System Testing - Overall (Testing the system as whole)
End to End Testing - Right from Login to order to submit -> delivery the product
Scope of Testing - Understanding the scope 
Non-Functioanl: Performance Testing (Stress/Load Testing) - Application can handle the load of many customers at the same time, Security testing

Installing/Release - To the customer 
Support/Maintenance 
UAT - Customers/End users
--------------
HLD - High levle Design - Page, logo 
LLD - Low level Design - compose , login, field

SDLC -> End to end development  - Software Development Life Cycle
Complete step by step process is called SDLC

Verification: Are we building the system, right? - Reviewing the doc-static testing
Validation: Are we building the right system? - Dynamic Testing

STLC-> Software Testing Life Cycle part of -> SDLC

Highlights
-----------
1. Manual Testing 
a. Software Testing Concepts b. Software Testing Project c. Tools
2. Tools - Testlink, Bugzilla, Jira, redmine - Evaluate which meets your project need/req
3. Interview guidance - before you hire team members for the project
4. Resume building - 
5. Certification - 
6. Notes & Recordings

Review of Test Cases-> to check whether it is written correctly or not & it should cover 100% of the customer requirement 
Review -> with the peer (QA team) or with the concerned developer(who has developed that particular code) 

===============

Day-2
S/W Testing Verification & Validation
Verification - Static Testing (Process of verifying the developing application is right or not) - Documents
Validation - Dynamic Testing (Process of validating the developed application)

SDLC - These two are sequential 
a. Waterfall model 
Adv: Easy to undetstand/design
Dis-Adv - Not designed for the big size
b. V - model
Adv - Save time, easy to follow, Better than Waterfall

2. Incremental 
a. RAD model - We have to develop apps within short time...Multiple teams to develop the applications. Adv - Saves time, quickly
b. Prototype - When the requirements are not clear or it may not be available. We develop DUMMY model
c. Spiral model - If the customer requirements 
d. Agile model - 5 use-cases Sprint #1 (short time - 2 or 3 weeks) -> Not in between -> change after seeing -> Dev (Will decide these changes can be given)

System Testing - White box or Black Box ?
White box - Developer
Black Box - do we see the code ? - Integration, Functional & System testing, Iterations(Multiple times)
Build 1.0-> Feat A & B -> Testing -> 1.3 A,B & C or fixed older bugs
GUI Testing - UI plays impt role - User friendly
Usability - How easy to use

Non-Functional - mean ? Performance /stress testing - Load Runner-Licensed, Jmeter (Free), security testing, cookie testing

Test Lead/Manager 
1. Scope of Testing is based on requirement
Effort also will vary (increase/decrease)
Compatibility -> Testing on two different Platforms or two or more browsers

Scope is limited to Manual Testing 10 hrs to complete 20 (1 man day is 8 hrs)
1. Depends upon the Complexity of AUT
2. Documents/feature 
3. Test Data - password field-> Cust Req-> Min 6 Max 8 char -> 1 spec, 1 numer, 1 Capital letter and rest can be alphabets-> Noted by Business-> SRS/SFS
4. Elements

Test Data Preparation Techniques -> Equivalence partition, Boundary value and Error guessing

Execution of the TC
Chrome - 8 hrs
FF - 8 hrs
Edge - 8 hrs

Total effort -> 10+8+8=26+3 hrs (3.5 days) (10 -> TC creation) 
Peer review - 2 hrs
Raise defect - 30 mins

RTM -> Requirement Traceability Matrix
https://www.guru99.com/traceability-matrix.html

QA Challenges 
1. Communication - GAP
2. Effort for QA - 
3. Setup (Hardware & Software) - IT/DevOPS
4. Cross compatibility - Scope of testing
5. Integration - 2 modules are closely coupled
6. Not delivering on time - QA
7. Requirements not clear
8. Co-ordination 
9. Time zone
10. Cross functional teams
11. Risk based testing based on the time or software (Ora 11 or Web)

Once the application is available to test
Execute the test cases

Good Tester: Attention to detail( Doc, TCs), No Assumption, Test to break attitude (Thinking negative, Improve the Quality), Destructive(negative), Debugging - Trace the errors, Good communication(Steps,logs/screenshot,title of the defect, TCs), Organized
Detailed Analysis of a project, Any module with different scenarios, prioritize the testing activity

Checkout - Epic (task)-> payment types (story)-> multiple tasks
Logout story-> multiple tasks associated 3 to 4 Dev tasks...2 or 3 Testing tasks-> are done)-> done


Features : A + B + C -> Another feature D

Regression Testing: Ensure that the recent code changes have not adversely affected the existing functionality (Break)
Scope: It involves re-executing previously executed tests works properly after the code change 

Smoke Testing (Build Verification Testing BVT): Important functionalities should work without any major issues
Objective: To determine if build is stable or not. To take it to the further testing activity. Initials builds
